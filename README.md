Simple Login Page

Clone this repository to your local machine: https://github.com/alchuu00/simple-login.git 

Create a new branch off the main branch. 

Name your new branch: dev-[your name]

The React project is already initialized for you.

Your task is to edit the file that is located under src/pages/login.tsx and make it match the design shown above.

For styling the components use ‘styled components’. I have already made an example for you. Here is styled components documentation: https://styled-components.com/docs 

Feel free to text me on Discord anytime if you are stuck with the task.

Once you recreate the design please make a pull request and I will review it.
